The content might differ slightly, but the format should look the same. A README is like a cover page to your GitHub repo and can be seen by anyone who looks at your GitHub projects. Therefore, it's important to take the time to create a well-written README for each projectâ€”especially if you want to showcase your work to future employers. As you work on projects throughout the boot camp, you will get plenty of experience writing effective README files.
